      <description>Challenge Descrption:
We&amp;rsquo;ve deployed a fairly simple program that can take input and display its hash in a number of different formats. It&amp;rsquo;s available on both Windows and Linux.
Get down in the weeds and see if you can understand how it works. You may want go beyond static analysis on this one. Try connecting it to a debugger (using default debugger settings!) and watch what requests it makes - I bet there&amp;rsquo;ll be a flag waiting.</description>

      <description>Light the was a challenge with a medium difficulty level that tested a person’s knowledge of the SCADA system. Before starting this challenge, I was clueless about this system. I learned a lot through this challenge, and I hope I can share some knowledge with you.

      <description>Attachment: File
Solution I started out by running the file.

      <description>A few days ago, while talking to a Computer Science major in my college, I figured out that not everyone should use Linux.
A disclaimer, when I say Linux I mean Linux Desktop. What I say here doesn&amp;rsquo;t apply to Linux servers.
Linux Linux is an open-source software developed by a guy named Linus Torvalds. Now countless many people are contributing to the code. Open source means that the software is free, and anyone with enough knowledge can change the code.</description>
