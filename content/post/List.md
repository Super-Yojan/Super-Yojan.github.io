# Lists

Two of the most common lists are Dymanic Array List and Linked List. Both of them have their own advantages 
and disadvantages. 


## Dymanic Array List

Dymanic Array List is a list that grows as more items are added onto the list. These are the most common types
of lists used by many programming languages. While it may seem easy to use and work with this types of list 
aren't very efficient. Let's look at how Dymanic Array works.

To make a Dymanic Array we start with a regular array with some default initial size. I will start with a 
list of size 2. Code for it could look something like. 

```rust
let mut array: [i32; 3] = [0; 3];
```
For this I will try to use rust to implement a Dymanic array.
