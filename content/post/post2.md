A few days ago, while talking to a Computer Science major in my college, I figured out that not everyone should use Linux.

***A disclaimer, when I say Linux I mean Linux Desktop. What I say here doesn't apply to Linux servers.***

# Linux
Linux is an open-source software developed by a guy named Linus Torvalds. Now countless many people are contributing to the code. Open source means that the software is free, and anyone with enough knowledge can change the code.
The name Linux is given to the kernel that runs all other software on top of it. Many people say that it should be called GNU/Linux mainly because the GNU project allows distribution and everything to come together. To me what we name things doesn’t matter much. We need to know where it came from and what makes it a possibility.
You might be asking So What’s so great about Linux?

## Why so great?
If you ask, why someone likes Linux to 3 different people, you will get 3 different answers. Some might say it’s because Linux is open-source, while others might say it’s because of the freedom and flexibility, some might also say because Linux is cool, heck someone might even say they like Linux because of how reliable it is. No matter whom you ask, a Linux user will always say that it’s better than windows, and Mac OS.

So, why do I think everyone shouldn’t use Linux?

## So, why not?


Many might think that I will go on and say things like, Linux is hard for beginners and not everyone will be able to tackle problems and fix them. No that’s not the main reason why I think everyone shouldn’t use Linux. Linux isn’t made for everyday normies.
Before you go on and say oh that’s the same thing as saying Linux is hard for beginners. No, it’s not the same thing, and I will explain why.
Let’s see whom I consider Normies and Technical for this case.

# Normies
For me, normies are regular people. They use the computer for browsing the internet, working on some spreadsheet. Someone who doesn’t care how things are happening, and how they want things to happen. A normie just wants to get the spreadsheet finished, they don’t care about how, or what they are using as long as they don’t have to work a lot and get things done.
People can argue that Linux can handle almost all the basic tools that Normies would want to use. Yes, I agree with that, but one thing that the Open-source and Linux community can’t get right will be the user experience and design.
Big corporations like Microsoft and Apple, hire people, to design things for normies. They pay normies to use their different designs and see which one will allow a normie to get things done with minimal effort. An open-source software can’t do that. People working on this software aren’t a normie, and they mostly create things the way they want. An Open-source developer wouldn’t go out and find 100 normies and ask about their experience while using the software.

# Technical 

For me, technical people are ones, who like to play around with the system, know what they want their system to do and how they want it to do. I wouldn’t consider a software engineer a technical person in this case if he/she doesn’t know what she wants in her system and how she wants it.
What do I mean by that?
Let’s say that I use my computer to design software, and write some code. That’s all I do, if I don’t know what kind of tools I want to use, let’s say I don’t know if I should use vim or VS code if I should use Libre Draw, or just use Microsoft Powerpoint. I don’t consider them technical for this instance.

# So who is it for?
To summarize the point, Linux is for technical people, who want to play around with their system, and fine-tune the system to their liking. There is no one fit for all solutions to things like this. Open-source communities and Linux Distros won’t spend thousands of dollars to get one fit for all systems.
There are thousands of distributions because everyone doesn’t like one thing, and since it’s easy to just start your distribution if you don’t find something that you like. We have so many distributions. This is a good thing and a bad thing. It’s a good thing for technical people, as they will have many options to choose from. For a regular user who just wants things to work without having to decide what they want to use Linux is not for them.
